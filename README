Newpods is a script that can find recently downloaded podcasts and then
insert the proper commands to copy them to a portable player into the
bash history list.

Run newpods once to install the user's configuration file to
$HOME/.newpodrc, and then customize it there.

For more information, run 'newpods -m'.

For installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.

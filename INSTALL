Linux, *BSD:

    Source Install:
    $ sudo make install

Mac OS X:

The 'make' program is not installed by default in OS X. Since
'newpods' is the only file you actually need, put it wherever you
like (or leave it in this directory).

    cd .  (or wherever you put 'newpods')
    alias newpods=". `pwd`/newpods"      <-- cut-and-paste this line into a terminal window
    alias newpods                        <-- execute this command, then cut-and-paste the
                                             result into your ~/.bashrc file.

Configuration:

After the package is installed, run it once to install the default
configuration file into $HOME/.newpodsrc, edit it to make 'source' and
'destinations' conform with your system.
